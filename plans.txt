 Mod Plans
===========

Focus:
-> We are making a mod that adds interesting food and cooking mechanics.
-> Interesting cooking processes are more important than tons of food varieties.
-> Hunger values with fall in line with vanilla values.
-> There will be two sets of textures: one default and one to match Blossom.

Details:
-> Cooking mechanics that involve temperature, doneness, taste, and texture.
-> Brewing juices and alcohols.
-> Foods ranging from snacks to complex meals.

How to Differentiate from HarvestCraft: (We don't want to step on anyone's toes.)
-> Less variety of food.
-> Cooking mechanics are more involved than basic crafting.
-> Lack of gardens and different methods of finding seeds.

How to Integrate with Unrelated Mods:
-> Utensils made from different materials may have different heating properties.
