 Todo List (+Rough Notes)
==========================

Goals for the Day:
-> Make acorn edible. +++
-> Enter custom titles and descriptions. +++
-> Add textures and names for items.
-> Plan out food mechanics. +++
-> Research dynamic texturing. +++
-> Create a meal object that has varying tastes (random for now).

Progress:
-> Add model and texture to teapot block.

Research:
-> Research a way to implement taste and texture mechanics.
-> Look into a way to have all alcohols under a single type.
-> See if we can remove the vanilla cake recipe.

NBT Research:
-> import net.minecraft.nbt.NBTTagCompound
-> use readFromNBT and writeToNBT
-> it looks like [get|set][type]() is used for single pairs?
-> i.e. short x = getShort('key');
-> and setInteger('key', 1);
-> these are operations on NBTTagCompound type

Tooltip Research:
-> relevant classes
    * net.minecraft.util.text.TextFormatting
    * net.minecraftforge.event.entity.player.ItemTooltipEvent
-> involves @Subscribe and @SideOnly('Client')
-> some sort of event gets called every time a tooltip is made
-> use event.getTooltip().add('string')

Dynamic Texture Research:
-> tile entities can use a custom renderer
-> maybe items can too?
