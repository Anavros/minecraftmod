 Todo List (+Rough Notes)
==========================

Goals for the Day:
-> Create textures for different ingredient states and meal types.
-> Vary food texture depending on NBT tags.
-> Add basic drinks.

Research:
-> See if we can remove the vanilla cake recipe. (not important right now)
-> How do we ensure every BoozeFood has full NBT tags?

NBT Research:
-> import net.minecraft.nbt.NBTTagCompound
-> use readFromNBT and writeToNBT
-> it looks like [get|set][type]() is used for single pairs?
-> i.e. short x = getShort('key');
-> and setInteger('key', 1);
-> use hasKey('key') to check for keys
-> these are operations on NBTTagCompound type
-> custom nbt-aware crafting recipes can be made
-> implement IRecipe and use GameRegistry.addRecipe(MyRecipeClass())

ItemStack NBT Data Research:
-> ItemStacks can be created by /give, crafting, or creative inventory.

Tooltip Research:
-> relevant classes
    * net.minecraft.util.text.TextFormatting
    * net.minecraftforge.event.entity.player.ItemTooltipEvent
-> involves @Subscribe and @SideOnly('Client')
-> some sort of event gets called every time a tooltip is made
-> use event.getTooltip().add('string')

Dynamic Texture Research:
-> tile entities can use a custom renderer
-> maybe items can too?
